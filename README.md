### **PGDM Acheivements**

#### Capstone Project 2 â€“ Job Seeker Analytics
Executed a dual-problem machine learning project using job seeker data from India (2021), focused on salary prediction and location preference classification. The dataset included demographic, educational, and professional attributes. The project aimed to uncover salary determinants and model geographic preferences using regression and classification techniques, supported by literature on predictive modeling and ensemble learning.

##### Problem Definition & Objectives
- Salary Prediction: Estimated expected salary using profile features; cleaned salary formats, standardized currency, and built regression models (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Location Preference Classification: Classified candidatesâ€™ preference for Delhi NCR using profile-based features; trained models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

##### Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

- Converted textual salary data to numeric format.
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot, label, and target encoding.
- Created binary target for location preference based on Delhi NCR cities (Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon, Faridabad).

##### Modeling & Evaluation

- Applied regression techniques with SHAP for explainability; evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².
- Built classification models and assessed performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

##### Literature Integration

- Benchmarked modeling choices against Kaggleâ€™s Data Science Salaries dataset and GPS-based trajectory prediction studies.
- Incorporated ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) and regularized regressions (Ridge, Lasso) for robustness.

##### Deployment & Documentation

- Deployed salary predictor via Streamlit.
- Visualized sentiment and location insights in Tableau.
- Documented workflows and results in GitHub for recruiter and stakeholder review.
